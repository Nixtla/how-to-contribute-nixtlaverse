# How to contribute to the Nixtlaverse


> This repository contains instructions for collaborating on the different libraries of Nixtla. The instructions are specific to [mlforecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/mlforecast) but can be applied to [statsforecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast) and [neuralforecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast) as well.

## 1. Create a fork of the mlforecast repo.
The first thing you need to do is create a fork of the GitHub repository to your own account:

Your fork on your account will look like this:

In that repository, you can make your changes and then request to have them added to the main repo.

## 2. Clone the repository.

In this tutorial, we use Mac (also compatible with other Linux distributions). If you are a collaborator of Nixtla, you can request an AWS instance to collaborate from there. If this is the case, reach out to Max or Fede on Slack to receive the appropriate access.

Once the repository is created, you need to clone it to your own computer. Simply copy the repository URL from GitHub as shown below:

Then open a terminal, type `git clone`, and paste the copied URL, like this:

The command will create a folder named mlforecast in the directory where you executed the command:
